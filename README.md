# Mobile-Price-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning-algorithm

The main idea of this project is to use the different algorithms of Machine Learning on the same dataset. This data set is downloaded from Kaggle and its name is Mobile Price Classification.

In this project we are using:
1. Logistic Regression
2. Naive Bayes
3. KNN
4. Neural Network

# Description of problem

This dataset has 2000 data and for every phone 20 features. The problem comes down to designing algorithms that will be able to classify the phone based on the given characteristics into one of 4 classes that correspond to certain price ranges. 

# Results

The data contained in this dataset is balanced, so we use accuracy as a measure of performance.

We get the following results:
1. Logistic Regression - accuracy = 97%
2. Naive Bayes - accuracy = 79%
3. KNN - accuracy = 67%
4. Neural Network - accuracy = 99%
